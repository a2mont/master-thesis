# Master Thesis on *Dynamic Local Remeshing for Elastoplastic Simulation*

## Project presentation

The goal of this project is to extend on the deformation algorithm presented in the paper [*Dynamic local remeshing
for elastoplastic simulation*](/Documentation/Papers/qt2sf0b2b5.pdf). To keep a locally injective transformation between the material space, in which the
remeshing is performed and no deformation occur, and the world space where external forces are applied to the
objects. Code, videos as well as a slideshow presentation are available at the following [*link*](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Wicke-DLR-2010-07/)

To perform the deformations, they use a set of mesh operations on tetrahedra of bad quality to dynamically
improve the geometry in the regions containing them. These operations are the following:

- **Smoothing**: This consist of moving vertices to improve the quality of the neighbouring elements. This is
the only operation that does not change the connectivity of the mesh.
- **Edge removal**: This consist of removing an edge from the mesh along with the tetrahedra containing it.
Different types of flips of tetrahedra allow this. The general formula for the tradeoff between the new and
old number of tetrahedra is to replace m tetrahedra with 2m âˆ’ 4 new ones.
- **Multi-face removal**: This is the inverse of the edge removal presented above. With the help of flips, we
aim to remove m faces by replacing 2m tetrahedra into m + 2.
- **Vertex insertion**: This is used in two cases, to increase the resolution of some part of the mesh or to
eliminate tetrahedra of poor quality. First, it hollows out a polyhedral cavity and then replaces the deleted
tetrahedra by new ones joining the new vertex to a face of the cavity. Vertex insertion is effective as part
of a compound operation, edge and multi-face removal are applied after the vertex insertion to evaluate the
quality of the mesh and accept or rollback the operation.
- **Edge contraction**: This has two uses, coarsen the mesh where its tetrahedra are unnecessarily small and
remove tetrahedra that have poor quality because an edge is too short. It removes an edge by by replacing
its endpoints by a single vertex. Every tetrahedron that shares the deleted edge is then also removed. This
operation can be rejected if it worsen the mesh quality.

To note is that these operations are constrained by the two spaces used. It could be that an operation is not
valid in both spaces simultaneously.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to understand and adapt the remeshing process presented in the paper as well as to see
how the material space can limit the improvement in the world space.

To do so, I will first implement similar operations as the ones presented in the previous section in the 2D domain.
This allows for a better understanding of the different challenges or difficulties that could arise in 3D before they
happen as well as to provide a simpler experimenting setting.

The second step will be to transcribe the 2D implementation into a 3D setting, working with tetrahedral meshes
similarly to the topology used in the paper.

Lastly and depending on the progress of the project, I could use my implementation in some sort of physics
simulation to test its capabilities and resistance to challenging scenarios or settings.
